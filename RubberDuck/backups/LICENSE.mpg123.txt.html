<a name="l51"><span class="ln">51   </span></a>  <span class="s0">This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</span>
<a name="l52"><span class="ln">52   </span></a><span class="s0">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</span>
<a name="l53"><span class="ln">53   </span></a><span class="s0">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</span>
<a name="l54"><span class="ln">54   </span></a><span class="s0">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</span>
<a name="l55"><span class="ln">55   </span></a><span class="s0">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</span>
<a name="l56"><span class="ln">56   </span></a><span class="s0">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</span>
<a name="l57"><span class="ln">57   </span></a>
<a name="l58"><span class="ln">58   </span></a>  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</span>
<a name="l59"><span class="ln">59   </span></a><span class="s0">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</span>
<a name="l60"><span class="ln">60   </span></a><span class="s0">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</span>
<a name="l61"><span class="ln">61   </span></a><span class="s0">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</span>
<a name="l62"><span class="ln">62   </span></a><span class="s0">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</span>
<a name="l63"><span class="ln">63   </span></a><span class="s0">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</span>
<a name="l64"><span class="ln">64   </span></a><span class="s0">these things.</span>
<a name="l65"><span class="ln">65   </span></a>
<a name="l66"><span class="ln">66   </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<a name="l67"><span class="ln">67   </span></a><span class="s0">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</span>
<a name="l68"><span class="ln">68   </span></a><span class="s0">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</span>
<a name="l69"><span class="ln">69   </span></a><span class="s0">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</span>
<a name="l70"><span class="ln">70   </span></a>
<a name="l71"><span class="ln">71   </span></a>  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<a name="l72"><span class="ln">72   </span></a><span class="s0">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<a name="l73"><span class="ln">73   </span></a><span class="s0">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<a name="l74"><span class="ln">74   </span></a><span class="s0">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</span>
<a name="l75"><span class="ln">75   </span></a><span class="s0">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</span>
<a name="l76"><span class="ln">76   </span></a><span class="s0">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<a name="l77"><span class="ln">77   </span></a><span class="s0">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>
<a name="l78"><span class="ln">78   </span></a>
<a name="l79"><span class="ln">79   </span></a>  <span class="s0">We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</span>
<a name="l80"><span class="ln">80   </span></a><span class="s0">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</span>
<a name="l81"><span class="ln">81   </span></a><span class="s0">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>
<a name="l82"><span class="ln">82   </span></a>
<a name="l83"><span class="ln">83   </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</span>
<a name="l84"><span class="ln">84   </span></a><span class="s0">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</span>
<a name="l85"><span class="ln">85   </span></a><span class="s0">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</span>
<a name="l86"><span class="ln">86   </span></a><span class="s0">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</span>
<a name="l87"><span class="ln">87   </span></a><span class="s0">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</span>
<a name="l88"><span class="ln">88   </span></a><span class="s0">introduced by others.</span>
<a name="l89"><span class="ln">89   </span></a>
<a name="l90"><span class="ln">90   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</span>
<a name="l91"><span class="ln">91   </span></a><span class="s0">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</span>
<a name="l92"><span class="ln">92   </span></a><span class="s0">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</span>
<a name="l93"><span class="ln">93   </span></a><span class="s0">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</span>
<a name="l94"><span class="ln">94   </span></a><span class="s0">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</span>
<a name="l95"><span class="ln">95   </span></a><span class="s0">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</span>
<a name="l96"><span class="ln">96   </span></a>
<a name="l97"><span class="ln">97   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</span>
<a name="l98"><span class="ln">98   </span></a><span class="s0">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</span>
<a name="l99"><span class="ln">99   </span></a><span class="s0">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</span>
<a name="l100"><span class="ln">100  </span></a><span class="s0">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</span>
<a name="l101"><span class="ln">101  </span></a><span class="s0">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</span>
<a name="l102"><span class="ln">102  </span></a><span class="s0">libraries into non-free programs.</span>
<a name="l103"><span class="ln">103  </span></a>
<a name="l104"><span class="ln">104  </span></a>  <span class="s0">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</span>
<a name="l105"><span class="ln">105  </span></a><span class="s0">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</span>
<a name="l106"><span class="ln">106  </span></a><span class="s0">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</span>
<a name="l107"><span class="ln">107  </span></a><span class="s0">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</span>
<a name="l108"><span class="ln">108  </span></a><span class="s0">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</span>
<a name="l109"><span class="ln">109  </span></a><span class="s0">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</span>
<a name="l110"><span class="ln">110  </span></a><span class="s0">the library.</span>
<a name="l111"><span class="ln">111  </span></a>
<a name="l112"><span class="ln">112  </span></a>  <span class="s0">We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</span>
<a name="l113"><span class="ln">113  </span></a><span class="s0">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</span>
<a name="l114"><span class="ln">114  </span></a><span class="s0">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</span>
<a name="l115"><span class="ln">115  </span></a><span class="s0">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</span>
<a name="l116"><span class="ln">116  </span></a><span class="s0">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</span>
<a name="l117"><span class="ln">117  </span></a><span class="s0">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</span>
<a name="l118"><span class="ln">118  </span></a><span class="s0">special circumstances.</span>
<a name="l119"><span class="ln">119  </span></a>
<a name="l120"><span class="ln">120  </span></a>  <span class="s0">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</span>
<a name="l121"><span class="ln">121  </span></a><span class="s0">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</span>
<a name="l122"><span class="ln">122  </span></a><span class="s0">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</span>
<a name="l123"><span class="ln">123  </span></a><span class="s0">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</span>
<a name="l124"><span class="ln">124  </span></a><span class="s0">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</span>
<a name="l125"><span class="ln">125  </span></a><span class="s0">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</span>
<a name="l126"><span class="ln">126  </span></a><span class="s0">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</span>
<a name="l127"><span class="ln">127  </span></a>
<a name="l128"><span class="ln">128  </span></a>  <span class="s0">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</span>
<a name="l129"><span class="ln">129  </span></a><span class="s0">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</span>
<a name="l130"><span class="ln">130  </span></a><span class="s0">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</span>
<a name="l131"><span class="ln">131  </span></a><span class="s0">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</span>
<a name="l132"><span class="ln">132  </span></a><span class="s0">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</span>
<a name="l133"><span class="ln">133  </span></a><span class="s0">system.</span>
<a name="l134"><span class="ln">134  </span></a>
<a name="l135"><span class="ln">135  </span></a>  <span class="s0">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</span>
<a name="l136"><span class="ln">136  </span></a><span class="s0">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</span>
<a name="l137"><span class="ln">137  </span></a><span class="s0">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</span>
<a name="l138"><span class="ln">138  </span></a><span class="s0">that program using a modified version of the Library.</span>

<a name="l524"><span class="ln">524  </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<a name="l525"><span class="ln">525  </span></a><span class="s0">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span>
<a name="l526"><span class="ln">526  </span></a><span class="s0">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>

<a name="l534"><span class="ln">534  </span></a>

<a name="l669"><span class="ln">669  </span></a><span class="s0">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span>
<a name="l670"><span class="ln">670  </span></a><span class="s0">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span>
<a name="l671"><span class="ln">671  </span></a><span class="s0">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span>

<a name="l677"><span class="ln">677  </span></a><span class="s0">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span>
<a name="l678"><span class="ln">678  </span></a><span class="s0">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<a name="l679"><span class="ln">679  </span></a><span class="s0">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<a name="l680"><span class="ln">680  </span></a><span class="s0">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<a name="l681"><span class="ln">681  </span></a><span class="s0">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
<a name="l682"><span class="ln">682  </span></a><span class="s0">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span>

<a name="l686"><span class="ln">686  </span></a><span class="s0">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<a name="l687"><span class="ln">687  </span></a><span class="s0">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span>
<a name="l688"><span class="ln">688  </span></a><span class="s0">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>

<a name="l697"><span class="ln">697  </span></a><span class="s0">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</span>

<a name="l699"><span class="ln">699  </span></a><span class="s0">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span>
<a name="l700"><span class="ln">700  </span></a><span class="s0">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<a name="l701"><span class="ln">701  </span></a><span class="s0">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span>
<a name="l702"><span class="ln">702  </span></a><span class="s0">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span>
<a name="l703"><span class="ln">703  </span></a><span class="s0">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span>
<a name="l704"><span class="ln">704  </span></a><span class="s0">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span>
